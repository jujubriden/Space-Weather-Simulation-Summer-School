1.
    a. The error decreases as N increases. As N gets sufficiently large, the error reduces by a smaller value.
    b. 0.25
    c. When a different Dirichlet BC is implemented, the convergence stays the same and the graph looks similar because we did not make any assumptions.

2.
    a. Source term and solution have more coefficients.
    b. Done. 0.5107 convergence for order 1.
    c. Done. 0.2501 convergence for order 2.
    d. More accurate.
